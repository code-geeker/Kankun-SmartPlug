running out of disk space should not brick your device. Hold down the button (5 secs) and power up. The led light should blink very fast.
Connect to the original access point and use the ssh/telnet/original user/password. Once you are in. Run the following commands


firstboot
mtd -r erase rootfs_data

The clicking of the relay suggests it not brick

xuong tong. I tried this. The button on the front appeared non functional as it would not even respond to manual relay on/off commands. The serial output of the device stopped at:

procd: - init complete -

every time and would not continue to root console. At this point the python script has allowed me to re-flash the device but I have not tested yet.

so you got to 10.56 secs. it seen the file system already. I still believe its not bricked
hold down the button and power on, only release after the led flashes quickly

Based on your output I would suspect the issue is not storage or memory, but rather some service I installed that was hanging. Once I put the device back together and retest I'll confirm if full functionality is restored. It may also be the case that the button is not tied to an interrupt which would explain the non-functional behavior.

Unless KK build their image without fail safe. hmm another reason why I did my own openwrt 15.05.1 image. 
If you can get access to the device. run  below to clear out your packages/work

firstboot
mtd -r erase rootfs_data ï»¿

Try this
Failsafe mode

When the configuration no longer allows you to log in via any network connection (e.g. lost password), the OpenWrt failsafe mode can be entered via the single "Reset" button on the device. However, in contrast to the generic failsafe instructions, for the TL-WR703N you have to wait for ca. 10 (10-12) seconds before pushing the "Reset" button after powering on the device. If the button is pushed immediately after powering on, the single blue LED will start blinking, supposedly indicating some failsafe firmware recovery mody of the embedded bootloader (not yet discovered how to use it). In this mode, the OpenWrt failsafe is not being started. Instead, wait for slightly longer than 10 seconds and - as soon as the LED starts blinking for the first time after powering on the device, push the "Reset" button for ca. 1-2 seconds. Immediately afterwards, the LED will blink rapidly (multiple Hz) and OpenWrt will be in failsafe mode.
- The above didn't work on a Ver 1.6 box running OpenWrt r33312. To get into failsafe mode, power up the device and wait until the LED starts flashing (about 2Hz). Once it starts flashing (within about 4 seconds) then quickly press the button. The LED will then flash much faster and the device will be in failsafe mode.

xuong. Thanks for the detailed notes as I think it will be good to have as a reference. In my case i could not achieve a blinking blue led. It would be solid at boot and then go off completely. I feel like i tried every combination of wait periods while attempting to enter failsafe via the button. Having had this conversation i noticed that failsafe mode can also be achieved via serial using:

Press the [f] key and hit [enter] to enter failsafe mode

directly after:

procd: - preinit - 

I'm also thinking that prior to attempting a re flash, performing the following may have been beneficial:

//validate image
md  0x81000000 25

//clean partition
erase 0x9f020000 +0x3c0000
cp.b 0x81000000 0x9f020000 0x3c0000
bootm 9f020000

One of mine did this left unplugged for an hour, plugged in. Powered off pressed switch on front held and powered up. Left pressed for 15 seconds. Let go and just left it, seemed to reset its self.
