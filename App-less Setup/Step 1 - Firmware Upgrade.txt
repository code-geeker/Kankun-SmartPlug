This should be the first step in setting these plugs up as all customization will be lost once the new firmware is applied. (Atleast until I provide my custom firmware and applications)

See using SSH and SCP and Default Passwords

SCP the latest firmware file to plug
SSH login to the plug

cd /tmp

Run the following command:

sysupgrade kkeps-3.5.bin

The plug will upgrade the firmware and reboot
