Download it from here

Then copy it onto the device, like so:
scp opkg-rc3.tar.gz root@192.168.10.253:/root/opkg-rc3.tar.gz


Then SSH into your device and unpack it, like so:
tar xz -C / -f /tmp/opkg-rc3.tar.gz

Then update it, like so:
opkg update
Note: this will fail due to rc3 on plug versus full release, change

/etc/opkg.conf

first line to:

src/gz barrier_breaker http://archive.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/packages/packages

then re-run opkg update


Now you can install things with:
opkg install {package name}

remove opkg binary from /bin to save space, you can re-add it as needed
