# Kankun Smart Plug
A collection of Firmware, Files and Scripts along with How-Tos for the Kankun Wi-Fi Smart Plug. These smart plugs are OpenWRT based and are vary open to modding/hacking and are only limited to the amount of space available and the limited GPIO access.

The manufacturer's software is buggy at best and uses Chinese servers to relay commands to/from these plus and your smart phone. Included in this repository is Scripts and How-To to solve the buggy issues, along with disabling the "Chinese control" by providing alernatives. Alot of these solutions are clones of other peoples repositories and work (see thanks below), however I will be including my own solutions / deriveds work along with a new firmware.
