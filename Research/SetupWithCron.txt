Joe Sebastian's Setup

This is messy, but it is my notes from working on the kankun smart socket. I have not implemented editing the cron file with a web page yet! I want to if I ever have time...
Bought and started using 7/2016
it is currently 11/2016 and I am still using this. I have never downloaded or used the KanKun app. I use PuTTY and WinSCP to connect to the plug from my windows machine. 


Right out of the box, or after a factory reset this is what I did. No need to mess with trying to get the app working, etc.

1. plug into power.
2. connect your PC to the WiFi SSID that the plug creates.
3. use putty to connect via ssh to 10.168.10.253. Use "root" for the username, and "p9z34c" for pw

you can now turn on and off the relay by typing the line below into the command line in Putty:

Turning the smart plug off:  echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/tp-link:blue:relay/brightness

Turning the smart plug on:  echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/tp-link:blue:relay/brightness


4. use vi  on \etc\rc.local and comment out the following lines by putting in a # at the beginning of the line like shown. This will prevent the plug from communicating with other things 

like the manufacturers servers, the smartphone apps, etc.
#/sbin/kkeps_on &
#/sbin/kkeps_off &
#/sbin/kkeps_seekwifi &
#/sbin/kkeps_reconect &

5. get the plug on your WiFi network:
	Use Vi or other means and add the following lines to /etc/config/network

config interface 'wwan'
        option proto 'static'
        option ipaddr '192.168.1.51'
        option netmask '255.255.255.0'
        option gateway '192.168.1.1'
        option dns '192.168.1.1'

	Use Vi or other means to edit the the following lines in /etc/config/wireless
	where you see "YOUR SSID" put the SSID of the WiFi you want it to connect to.
	where you see "YOUR KEY" put the WiFi password or key.

config wifi-iface
        option device   radio0
        option network  wwan
        option mode     sta
        option ssid     "YOUR SSID"
        option key      "YOUR KEY"
        option encryption psk

I would reboot and be sure the plug connects, etc.
Now we should shut off the DHCP and DNS server in the plug.
You will have to be logged into the plug and type dnsmasq disable



if you want the plug to schedule turning the socket power on and off then you will need the time synchronized and the cron deamon running.
type the following 2 lines:
/etc/init.d/cron enable
mkdir -p /var/spool/cron


to have the schedule work you need to type:
crontab -e
This will cron in VI and editing the crontab file.
the commands below turn the light on at 6pm and off at 11:30

00 18 * * * echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/tp-link:blue:relay/brightness
30 23 * * * echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/tp-link:blue:relay/brightness



I edited /etc/config/system:
See Below:
I changed the hostname and the time Zone. It has daylight savings time programmed in so we will see if it works.
I made the blue light do a little blink every 10 seconds to see if it was running, but not leave on as some people complained that it was bright and I dont want to draw attention to the 

plug as kids follow the blue light then mess with it!!!


config system
	option hostname 'FamilyRoomLamp'
	option zonename 'Eastern Time'
	option timezone 'EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0'
	option conloglevel '8'
	option cronloglevel '8'

config timeserver 'ntp'
	list server '0.openwrt.pool.ntp.org'
	list server '1.openwrt.pool.ntp.org'
	list server '2.openwrt.pool.ntp.org'
	list server '3.openwrt.pool.ntp.org'
	option enable_server '0'

config restorefactory
	option button 'reset'
	option action 'pressed'
	option timeout '2'

config led
	option name 'flashing'
	option sysfs 'tp-link:blue:config'
	option trigger 'timer'
	option delayon '10000'
	option delayoff '10'

config led
	option name 'Relay'
	option sysfs 'tp-link:blue:relay'
	option trigger 'none'
	option default '1'



12:18 PM 11/3/2016
Wanted to reboot the plug if it lost connection to the router. so I put a file called conncheck in the /root/ dir ( I made it executable by changing properties in winSCP) The file contains: 
ROUTER=192.168.1.1
ping -c 3 $ROUTER > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
  reboot
fi


I also added the first line below to the crontab file:
*/10 * * * * /root/conncheck
00 18 * * * echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/tp-link:blue:relay/brightness
30 23 * * * echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/tp-link:blue:relay/brightness


Thought about  doing this instead of a reboot to avoid the relay turning off if it is on during the reboot, but I never
 did...

/etc/init.d/network restart
