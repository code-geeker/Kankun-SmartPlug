Thanks to Mark Neil Aves' suggestion to use an MQTT client instead of HTTP to control the Kankun, I'm testing this primitive MQTT subscribe wrapper. It requires the mosquitto-client-nossl package. If you don't know about MQTT, this probably isn't for you.

#!/bin/sh
BROKER="your.mqtt.broker.ip.address"
TOPIC="esp/relay/1"
RELAY="/sys/class/leds/tp-link:blue:relay/brightness"
RELAYON=1
RELAYOFF=0

mosquitto_sub -h "$BROKER" -t "$TOPIC" | while read line
do
    line=`echo $line | tr [A-Z] [a-z]`
    echo "message = $line"
    if [ "$line" == "on" ]; then
        echo $RELAYON >> $RELAY
        echo "message = on"
    elif [ "$line" == "off" ]; then
        echo $RELAYOFF >> $RELAY
        echo "message = off"
    else
    echo "message incorrect"
    fi
done
