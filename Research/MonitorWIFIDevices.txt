I have created a script which monitors for connected devices on the KK and then take action without voice/key press. Open the garage door when you are close to it.  Or turn off devices when you have left home.  Here's a skeleton of the script. Save/Edit  and run it in background

#!/bin/sh
export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin

# You phone mac address
MAC="00:00:00:00:00:00"

currentStatus=0
count=0

switchOn(){
        echo "on"
}

switchOff(){
        echo "off"
}

while [ 1 ]; do
        sleep 15
        status=0
        for interface in `iw dev | grep Interface | cut -f 2 -s -d" "`; do
                if iw dev $interface station dump | grep Station | cut -f 2 -s -d" "|grep -i -w -q $MAC; then
                        status=1
                fi
        done
        if  [ "$status" = "1" ]; then
                count=0
                if [ "$currentStatus" != "$status" ]; then
                        switchOn
                        currentStatus=$status
                fi
        else
                if [ "$currentStatus" != "$status" ]; then
                        count=`expr $count + 1`
                fi
                if [ "$count" = "2" ]; then
                        switchOff
                        currentStatus=$status
                        count=0
                fi
        fi
done
