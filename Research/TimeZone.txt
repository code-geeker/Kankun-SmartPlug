Actually settinfs come from /etc/config/system 

edit them there!



old info:

edit 

/etc/TZ

Confusingly, the offset in the TZ value specifies the time value you must add to the local time to get a UTC value, so this is positive if the local time zone is west of the Prime Meridian and negative if it is east. As a result, TZ must be set to GMT-8 for a timezone that is GMT+8.

+7 offset for MST


/etc/init.d/boot
change lines 20-22

	config_get timezone "$cfg" timezone 'UTC'
	# echo "$timezone" > /tmp/TZ
	echo CST+7 > /etc/TZ
