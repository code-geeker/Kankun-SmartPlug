What is the pins on WiFi PCB at bottom side ("J4" at the bottom face side of the PCB)? It's looks like:
     - RX_P4
     - RX_N4
     - TX_P4
     - TX_N4
     - TX_P3
     - TX_N3
     - RX_P3
     - RX_N3
     - ? (ground?)
     - ? (looks like AVDD20)
     - USB_DM
     - USB_PM

2) What is the male (on the WiFi PCB and female on the "power" PCB) 6-pins? According to annotation on the power PCB, there are 3V3, GND, LED1, LED2 and (I guess) signal to relay. Maybe anybody knows it defenetely?
